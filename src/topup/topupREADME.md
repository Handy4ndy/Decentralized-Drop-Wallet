# TopUp Hook

This hook is designed to handle top-up requests by ensuring the balance of a specified account does not fall below a minimum amount and to configure the treasury top-up payment.

## Overview

The hook performs the following steps:

1. Retrieves the minimum amount parameter (`A`) and the destination account parameter (`D`) from the hook parameters.
2. Checks if the transaction is outgoing from the specified account.
3. Fetches the keylet for the specified account and retrieves its balance.
4. Ensures the transaction amount is in Xah (8 bytes).
5. Converts the transaction amount to drops and calculates the final balance after the transaction.
6. If the final balance is less than the minimum amount, reserves space for one emitted transaction.
7. Prepares and emits a transaction to top up the account balance.


## Treasury Top-Up Payment

The hook also handles the configuration of treasury top-up payments:

1. Retrieves the balance of the requesting account from the hook parameters.
2. Checks if the transaction is outgoing from the specified account.
3. Retrieves the amount to be sent to the destination account from the transaction parameters.
4. Retrieves the destination account from the transaction parameters.
5. Fetches the keylet for the destination account and verifies its existence.
6. Sets the state entry for the requester account with the specified amount.
7. Completes the configuration successfully if all steps are successful.

## Error Handling

The hook includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If the minimum amount parameter (`A`) is not set.
- If the destination account parameter (`D`) is not set.
- If fetching the keylet for the specified account fails.
- If the transaction amount is not in Xah (8 bytes).
- If the balance of the requesting account is not set.
- If the amount to be sent to the destination account is not specified.
- If the destination account is not specified.
- If the destination account does not exist.
- If setting the state entry for the requester account fails.

## Example Usage

To use this hook, set the parameters as follows:

- Minimum Amount: "A" (8 bytes)
- Destination Account: "D" (20 bytes)
- Balance of the Requesting Account: "B" (8 bytes)
- Amount to be Sent: "A" (8 bytes)
- Destination Account for Top-Up: "D" (20 bytes)
